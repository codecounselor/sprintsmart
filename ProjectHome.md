<h2>Tools to support Agile Sprint Estimation and Planning</h2>

This project was designed for Scrum Masters who must make project commitments that align with an enterprise release plan many iterations into the backlog.

The application will generate a visual representation of what your development team(s) can commit to over a fixed series of time boxed sprints.

You may find it most useful if you have to generate roadmaps across several teams.  It will help you visualize cross dependencies and help increase confidence when making longer term commitments.
